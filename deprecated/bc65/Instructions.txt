Welcome to xHarbour.com SQLRDD for Borland compiler!
----------------------------------------------------

Please read whole file before starting.

We strongly suggest you to try the samples shipped with this package before
introduce SQLRDD to your applications. Doing this, you will be familiar with
database connection issues.

We also recommend you to read SQLRDD manual and metodology files, located
in \SQLRDD\doc folder.



Building the samples
--------------------


The supplied bat file to build the samples is:

\SQLRDD\samples\SQLRDD\make.bat

You must use xHarbour 1.2.1 (minimun) to build the samples.

To be sure of what xHarbour version do you have, please execute:

\xHarbour\bin\harbour /build

The build bat files assume your xHarbour installation is located in \xHarbour
folder, in the same disk drive you installed SQLRDD. If your xHarbour folder is
in a different location, please edit the build.bat file and change it to correct
place.

You also have to edit sqlrdd.ini and change the connection parameters to your
database(s).

We recommend you to start with demo01. This sample shows how regular xBase
commands and functions (like dbCreate(), INDEX, GoTop(), Seek(), SKIP, eof(), etc.,
can work with SQL databases in same fashion of plain DBF files!


Building your application with SQLRDD
-------------------------------------


It's very easy to build your applications with SQLRDD, following these steps:

1 - Add \SQLRDD\include folder to your include folders list

2 - Add \SQLRDD\lib and/or \SQLRDD\lib\0.99.71 to your lib folders list,
    depending on xHarbour version you are currently using: .99.70 or .99.71.
    To be sure what's your current xHarbour version, execute
    \xharbour\bin\harbour.exe /build

3 - Add sql.lib to your project, as well as the target database libs that can 
    be found in \SQLRDD\lib


Changes required in your source code:

If your application already runs in xHarbour with DBF files, you will need to
make the following changes:

1 - Add database connection instructions. You can use the ones in
    samples\SQLRDD folder. See samples\SQLRDD\connect.prg.

2 - Upload your DBF files to database. You may use samples\SQLRDD\dbf2sql.prg
    for this.

3 - Add needed REQUESTs and include files in your main PRG:

#include "sqlrdd.ch"       // SQLRDD Main include
#include "pgs.ch"          // Needed if you plan to use native connection to Postgres
#include "mysql.ch"        // Needed if you plan to use native connection to MySQL
#include "oracle.ch"       // Needed if you plan to use native connection to Oracle
#include "firebird.ch"     // Needed if you plan to use native connection to Firebird

REQUEST SQLRDD             // SQLRDD should be linked in
REQUEST SR_ODBC            // Needed if you plan to connect with ODBC
REQUEST SR_PGS             // Needed if you plan to use native connection to Postgres
REQUEST SR_MYSQL           // Needed if you plan to use native connection to MySQL
REQUEST SR_ORACLE          // Needed if you plan to use native connection to Oracle
REQUEST SR_FIREBIRD        // Needed if you plan to use native connection to Firebird
